"""Routing report — what the router actually served, and what it saved.

Reads the live decision log written by `server/jev_server.py`
(`~/.codex/codex-router/jev-router-live.jsonl`: one JSON line per decision, with
`at`, `gate`, `tier`, `conf`, `depth`, `model`, `effort`, `speed`, `jev_ms`,
`total_ms`, ...) and prints, over a window of N days:

  - the distribution of the models/tiers served (luna / terra / sol / astra, plus the
    Codex-dry tandem when it took over);
  - the share of turns served by the cheapest tier (luna);
  - the gates the policy went through (`apply`, `hold(sol)`, `hold(luna_step)`,
    `codex_dry(...)`, ...);
  - the median latency (end-to-end and Jev's own decision time);
  - an estimate of the real cost against two counterfactual baselines — every
    turn on astra, every turn on sol — in documented relative units.

It also reads the backtest aggregate (`~/.codex/codex-router/jev-backtest.json`,
written by `poc/backtest_savings.py --days N`, see BACKTEST.md) when present and
echoes its simulated API-equivalent USD figures, based on recorded token usage.

Usage:
    python3 server/report_routing.py                  # last 7 days, text table
    python3 server/report_routing.py --days 30
    python3 server/report_routing.py --days 7 --json  # machine-readable

Cost hypothesis (relative units, luna = 1)
-------------------------------------------
Legacy log entries carry no token counts. Alongside the observed-token
credit estimates for new entries, the historical cost block uses published
list rates and a deliberately synthetic fixed token mix. These legacy figures
are illustrative and are not an estimate of any operator's actual spending:

    astra $10.00/$50.00 · sol $4.00/$20.00 · luna $0.20/$1.20 (standard)

One unit = one standard-speed luna turn. Historical Fast calls retain their
API x2 multiplier according to the logged speed; changing the current policy
must not re-price the past as standard. Legacy luna entries without a speed
are assumed Fast, as required by the policy that wrote them.
The native-only comparison excludes external fallback calls.

Assumptions worth reading before quoting a number:
  - token volume per call is held constant across scenarios; changes in effort,
    retries, success rate, and Jev cost are not modelled;
  - prompt-cache invalidation from switching models mid-thread is not modelled
    (per-model caches), so real-world savings can be lower;
  - the baselines are API-equivalent counterfactuals, not invoices: no turn is
    re-served, and Codex-dry turns (served by the Go tandem, off-peak rates) are
    compared against native tiers they did not consume in the mixed report.
  - ChatGPT quota/credit accounting is not API USD billing; neither comparison
    measures actual Codex quota saved.
