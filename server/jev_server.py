"""Jev Codex Router — local server on 127.0.0.1:4319 for the Codex Router.

Receives Responses requests destined for the "jev/auto" model (the Codex
Router's "jev" generic provider), asks Jev through TypeSafe or OpenRouter for a tier
and a thinking depth, applies the routing policy, then relays to the Codex
Router's local caller edge (native session sharing enabled) — with no format
conversion: Responses in, Responses out, SSE relayed verbatim.

Routing policy: Jev independently classifies the mandatory-Astra policy, chooses
one capability tier, one thinking depth and a bounded route lease in a single
typed request. Code combines those answers and forces Astra for pre-project
architecture, independent final code review or risk-focused review. Routine
quality checkpoints use ordinary capability routing. Every pair uses standard
speed. Confidence is logged without changing other valid choices. There are no
keyword overrides or production target proportions.
Technical Jev failures remain fail-open to astra @medium and are logged separately.

Measured routing (v11): every user turn, error, compaction and material tool-chain
transition is judged independently. A Jev-selected lease may reuse the exact
model/effort across clean continuations, avoiding a paid router call and cache
thrash without masking changed state. Jev sees bounded cache affinity for the
current private session: actual per-model cache-read evidence, its age and the
last measured context size. A successful call with no cache read is only
``warming``; it is never mislabeled as a hit. Capability remains primary, but a
sufficient hot model avoids a needless cold replay. Provider retries inside one
call retain its decision. The compact Jev projection is
judgment input only: the executing model always receives the caller's canonical
request in full, never that projection. Routing changes only transport controls
and may add Astra's documented configuration update. The prompt_cache_key
passes through untouched, allowing each selected model to reuse its own cache
for this session; caches are not assumed to be shared across different models.
Context continuity does not depend on those cache hits: every selected model
receives the full canonical request. Cache reuse only changes how much of that
identical prefix the provider must process and bill again.

Input handling (v8): Jev sees the current ask, never the thread — the task is
Codex's last user text, with Codex's own machine-generated envelopes stripped
(goal context, plugin catalog, environment, skills) and clipped head+tail.
Thread length never reaches the judge. A tool continuation adds a bounded
batch summary (errors first) and a short assistant-intent tail. The complete
history, instructions, tools, results and compaction handoff remain exclusively
in the canonical request sent to the executing model. A short context-dependent
ask such as "continue" also gets one bounded active-task summary: the goal
envelope when present, otherwise the preceding meaningful user ask; a short
confirmation also gets the last assistant proposal.
Fail-open: any Jev error → astra @medium. Kill switch: file
~/.codex/codex-router/jev-router.off → relay astra without a decision.
Shadow: file ~/.codex/codex-router/jev-router.shadow → decide and log the
route, but serve plain astra (quality-neutral data collection).
Debug: file ~/.codex/codex-router/jev-router.debug → dump request shapes
(jev-router-debug.jsonl) and transport counters (jev-router-debug-stream.log).
All POSTs require the parent's protected Jev provider credential. Diagnostic
logs are owner-only, bounded and contain no new prompt or generated-text excerpts.
Display: streamed reasoning summaries get the routed tag appended in place
( · 🧠sol:low · ) so the Codex thread shows the picked model per call.
The same rewriter keeps one response id across a relayed stream: a fallback stream
has already crossed the local edge once, so its terminal event carries a
re-encrypted id, and the Responses consumer in front of us refuses a completion
whose id differs from the one `response.created` announced.
Non-stream callers (auto-compaction checkpoints, litellm non-stream path)
receive the SSE stream reassembled into a single JSON response object.
Balance: sufficient capability and effort for the next decision, including
compaction. Capability profiles are priors; outcome quality requires evaluation.
Log: ~/.codex/codex-router/jev-router-live.jsonl

Codex-dry fallback: when native usage is exhausted — a manual flag file
(~/.codex/codex-router/jev-router.codex-dry) or an observed quota failure
(429 / usage-limit body) — the native model ladder is replaced until the window resets:
the embedded router discovers up to two compatible configured routes locally.
Jev never receives that inventory. Environment settings can still select
distinct standard/frontier targets explicitly. A quota failure flips the state
and retries the same canonical call; a successful native
call clears an auto state (never the manual flag). A fallback call that comes
back retryable (429/5xx) is tried once on a distinct configured candidate only,
before sending any error to the client. The decided depth travels with the call, mapped onto the Go
ladder (low/high/max): a low step stays low, medium and high become high, and
xhigh or above become max.
